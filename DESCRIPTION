Package: STDataMGMT
Title: Generate Private Data the Stress Test
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: The goal of STDataMGMT is to provide the input data required
    for the stress test that cannot be shared as part of a public
    repository. The 2DII stress test needs several external data inputs
    that usually require a license which prohibits redistributing the
    data. 2DII does not have the right to publicly share that data though,
    which is why this repository needs to stay private.The repository will
    be used to point the main stress testing code to, when said data needs
    to be loaded. This allows publishing the code containing 2DII's main
    climate stress testing methodology open source.
